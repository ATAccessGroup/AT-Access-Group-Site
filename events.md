Meetings
-------------

We try and hold two day long meetings per year to enable members to meet up, discuss cases and share knowledge. 

The next meeting is on the 7th May at [ACT Birmingham](http://www.bhamcommunity.nhs.uk/about-us/clinical-services/specialist-services/rehabilitation/services/act/). Time: 10-4. Please let us know if you can make it [here](http://bit.ly/ataspring2015).  Agenda to be confirmed.. (Watch this space!)

A list of the previous meetings - and the [minutes from these can be found in the members area](members/meetings.md). 

Two Day National Training Event (NTE)
-------------

A two day National Training Event will be attempted every other year. The next event is scheduled for 2015 and will be at the Royal Hospital for Neurodisability. Jane Bache will be leading the organisation of this. More information to follow. 

Note that we ask contributors to share any slides and presentations for non-members. The 2012 NTE archive of these presentations can be found [here](events/nte-2012.md).
