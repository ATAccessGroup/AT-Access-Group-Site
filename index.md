The Group aims to bring together those professional’s working in and/or with an interest in the specialist field of Access to Electronic Assistive Technology (EAT). EAT includes technology to help people communicate (e.g. [AAC](http://www.communicationmatters.org.uk/page/what-is-aac)), daily living activities (e.g. Environmental Control) and leisure activities (e.g. reading, playing games etc.). 

Our Objectives include:
 * To share learning and best practice.
 * To recognise excellence and promote good practice.
 * To develop an evidence base for best practice.
 * To facilitate the professional development of the group, including identifying and meeting any training needs.
 * To organise and facilitate a bi-annual conference.
 * To promote an understanding of Alternative Access to the wider professional communities and public.

As well as planning and organising a two day national training event, we meet twice a year at a convienient location around the country and converse online in an email group.  You can read the full [terms of reference here](terms-of-reference.md).
