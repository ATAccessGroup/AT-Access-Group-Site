* [Emptech](http://www.emptech.info/) lists a huge list of software. Although some of the entries can no longer be found online it does act as a good place to look for software and resource making software - particularly in the education area
* [AccessApps](http://eduapps.openforeducation.org/?page_id=67) is a JISC Techdis initiative that provides a large downloadable installer of a range of software in one go. Its a pretty neat start to get you up and running if you are looking at free and open source software.
