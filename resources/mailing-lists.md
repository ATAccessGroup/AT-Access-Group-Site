Email Lists
=====

There are a number of email resources to be aware of if you are are wanting to ask for advice, ideas and link up with others in the near or far neighbourhood!

The first to mention is the email group associated with this site. Its a friendly, fairly low-volume, email list largely consisting of OT's and some Rehab Engineers, Clinical/Assistive Technologists and Scientists. The aim is to provide email support, discussion and debate for your professional work. If you are a member you can [view the list archive here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-GB&fromgroups#!forum/access-group). It uses Google Groups to manage the list - so if you have a Google address its easiest to sign-up with that or link your work account with Google (you can do that [here](https://www.google.com/settings/)). Just place your email address in the box below if you would like to join:

  * [Assistech](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=assistech) is a UK email list group a little more technical. If you have a technical query then you may like to lurk here
  * The [CM-AAC Forum](http://groups.google.com/d/forum/cm-aac-forum?fromgroups] is the email forum of the Communication Matters group - the UK branch of people working in and with AAC (Alternative Augmentative Communication)
  * [QIAT](http://natri.uky.edu/assoc_projects/qiat/listserv.html) is a US based email list which is extremely busy. It does however keep you abreast of a lot of new and updated AT software and solutions. Is quite education focused with a lot of educators in the US posting on it
